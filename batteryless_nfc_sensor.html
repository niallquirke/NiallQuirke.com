						<li class="project_heading"> A Batteryless NFC Sensor</li>
						</br>
						<li> The idea for my final year project came from the huge potential I seen in a batteryless sensor for IOT applications and the realization that this could be made possible using NFC technology - I was majoring in IOT engineering. </li>
						</br>
						<li> For example, if you had a NFC batteryless air-pressure sensor on the inside of your bike or car tyre, to check the tyre pressure all you'd have to do is tap your phone off the outside of the tyre. No battery means it lasts forever, it's very cheap and it's very easy to use!</li>
						</br>
						<li> This project included:</li>
						</br>
						<li> Developing an android app to connect to the sensor through NFC and present data coming from the sensor.</li>
						<li> Designing an NFC induction antenna to maximize power transfer from the phone to the sensor.</li>
						<li> Designing a signal processing circuit to turn the NFC signal into encoded binary the microchip could understand.</li>
						<li> Writing low level C code for the microchip to collect data from a sensor and run the NFC protocol for communication with the phone on extremely low-power.</li>
