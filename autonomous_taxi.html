						<li class="project_heading"> An Autonomous Taxi</li>
						</br>
						<li> This project included:</li>
						</br>
						<li> Designing, building and writing software for an autonomous car on a team of 4.</li>
						<li> The car was directed by a microcontroller using sensors to follow white lines on a black map and requesting its next destination from a server linked to a website.</li>
						<li> As our innovation piece for the project our car would go to a certain station depending on the fingerprint entered to the scanner.</li>
						<li> As the Computer Engineer on a team of three Mechatronic Engineers I was responsible for most of the code and biometrics implementation.</li>
						<li> We finished 2nd out of 22 in the final competition.</li>
